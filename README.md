# Hello my name is Katherine

I'm currently working as an analyst with the Federal government.

I completed a BA and MA degree in Criminology at Simon Fraser University. 

I have no experience with web development but I was interested in learning a bit about it so that is why I am currently taking the Introduction to Web Development course at the University of Alberta. 

I am most familiar with the macOS operating system and I am starting to learn about GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
